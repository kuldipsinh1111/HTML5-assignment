    Vector based (composed of shapes)                    Raster based (composed of pixel)    
 
    SVG has better scalability. So it                    Canvas has poor scalability. Hence it 
    can be printed with high quality                     not suitable for printing on higher
    at any resolution.                                   resolution.
